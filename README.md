# Spam Classifier

A machine learning project for detecting spam messages using Python.

## Overview

This project aims to build a robust spam classifier that distinguishes between spam and non-spam (ham) messages using various machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Preprocessing and cleaning of text data
- Feature extraction (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF)
- Training and evaluation of multiple ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Easy-to-use scripts for training, testing, and predicting

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gcdinesh/spam_classifier.git
    cd spam_classifier
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Train the model:
```bash
python train.py --data data/spam.csv
```

Predict new messages:
```bash
python predict.py --model model.pkl --message "Your free lottery ticket is waiting!"
```
